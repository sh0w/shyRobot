# shy robot
C, Arduino microcontroller

this shy, anxious robot is afraid of you and rolls away when you try to touch it.

an infrared motion sensor is used on the robotâ€™s back to detect people approaching the robot, and an ultrasonic proximity sensor in the front detects obstacles for the robot to avoid.
